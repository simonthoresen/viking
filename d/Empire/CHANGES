2014-10-08 Khaine
- Added EMP_D_FILTER that extends D_FILTER, and provides does_inherit() and
  does_not_inherit().

2014-10-03 Khaine
- Added EMP_I_CALL_OUT, which adds call_out_unique() method to all base
  classes. This call will first remove any existing call_outs to the
  same method.
- Added EMP_I_MONSTER_MESSAGE that provides set_destroy_msg().

2014-10-02 Khaine

  island/dragon/std/room and island/blackrock/std/room_crumb

2014-10-01 Khaine

  to assist with implementing the wings.

2014-09-08 Khaine
- Added EMP_D_LIST for rendering lists with variable width.

2014-08-21 Khaine
- Added a heart_beat hook to all livings that hold the empire badge, and use
  that hook to call living_heart_beat() in empire rooms. This reduces the cpu
  cost of environmental effects across the empire.
- Removed heart_beat from map_a, map_d, map_l and map_t. Environmental effects
  implemented by way of the new living_heart_beat() call from badge.
- Changed EMP_C_LIMB to inherit C_CORPSE to remove heart_beat() from all limbs,
  as well as use more of mudlib.
- Changed EMP_C_LIMBLOSS, EMP_C_REINS, EMP_C_STUN and EMP_C_WOUND to use a
  __heart_beat hook instead of an explicit heart beat.

2014-08-20 Khaine

- Created EMP_I_LOGD, and made EMP_D_LOG inherit that.

  2x hp, 1.5x str, spell chance +10%

2014-06-27 Khaine

  auto-loading item that can be crafted into a non-autoloading super bag.

2014-06-14 Khaine

2013-03-29 Azatoth
- Azatoth added basic IDs to weapond, and added magic property to enchanted
  items. Enchanted items will now also have a basic set_info for identify
  spells.

2012-07-06 Azatoth
- Viscidious ring with reduced crit chance. We had mages doing 500k xp in 2
  minutes with this ring. Rember that there are areas WITH THEIR OWN critical
  systems, when you put another on top... it goes bad _very_ quickly.
- Imhotep with reduced stat effects. The new gear is so good, and does no longer
  require a quest to get that there is no reason one should also get insane stat
  boost for killing. Some players were soloing this mob without much
  difficulty. Imhotep's HP reduced.
- Serpent spirit reduced regen from 5sp to 2SP per round. 5 SP non-slot is
  simply way too much. Serpent was reduced in hitpoints from this also.
- Kaleb's sword made weight 6. It was much too good to be a leftie.
- Kaleb's ring had resistances cut to 25%. Don't give out 100% resistances so
  readily! A game must be exciting, knowing beforehand you have all damage of a
  certain type reduced by 1/3...  when damage is usually well below your max
  hitpoints...  takes away that excitement. At the minimum if you do give 100%
  resist, it can only to be to _ONE_ type and it must be an item with a backdraw
  of some sort... making it more of a solution to taking down a mob than
  something you run around with permanently.
- Akol sword set to weigth 2
- Akol helmet set to reduce random(dmg/2). Devotion was possible to get too
  high, and running around with 40% chance to remove all damage is not
  passable. Remember that gear and others powers stack!
- Kalis book changed from hitting query_attackers() to query_attack().  The
  potential of the weapon becomes to high in multimob areas, especially now that
  we have so many with endless spawns.
- Reduced ring and amulet values from liches and mind flayers. Penalized regen
  powers more.
- Capped potions in potionshop to 20 per reset. Price reduced to 18k
- Reduced max dmg on Lord Random a little.

2012-06-21 Azatoth
- Azatoth capped number of spawns from chaos portal to 25.  Players used portal
  to gain excessive amounts of XP very easily. This could be rewritten in some
  other form I guess, but for now a cap is in place.

2013-06.20 Azatoth
- Azatoth reduced resist from Jormungand amulet and onyxia blood. Yes, they are
  rare spawns... but these are items for highlevel sessions - so let's keep a
  reason for stacking up res from other rewards in the game.

2013-06-13 Azatoth
- Azatoth make kalis spellbook unique, changed potion cost in altdorf to 20k,
  reduced regeneration from rings and amulets somewhat
