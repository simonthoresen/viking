This encounter will spawn a portal that lasts for 1 hour. This portal
will keep spawning critters from the chaos island until there are at
least 20 critters alive. The invading critters will wander around the
roads of altdorf on random and attack all other livings.

The portal itself can be entered, teleporting the player into the
chaos island. Only inside that island can one trigger Angron as a
separate event.
