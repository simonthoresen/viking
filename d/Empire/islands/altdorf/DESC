This island is running on the same library as Matouci, and such the only thing
that would really need QC would be the content of this directory and it's
subdirectories. 

However, when creating the content for these rooms I also ported Reikland's
D_SPAWN daemon into the Empire library. This is now:
- /d/Empire/daemons/armourd
- /d/Empire/daemons/containerd
- /d/Empire/daemons/treasured
- /d/Empire/daemons/weapond

The enchantment part of Reikland's D_SPAWN has been replaced by Runewaker's
enchantment daemon, defined as EMP_D_ENCHANT in /d/Empire/empire.h so that
anyone has easy access to it. The daemon adds a random enchant to an item, based
on the enchant power given (0 being nothing, 100 being a level 29 enchant). The
code resides in "/d/Runewaker/daemons/enchantd"

Keep in mind that this QC submission is merely to get the area open, there is no
dynamic content right now (none of the events are enabled). I will submit events
one at a time following the opening of the area.

I wish to have this room hooked into the jetty in larstown by an "altdorf" exit,
similar to how the docks in altdorf has a "larstown" exit.
