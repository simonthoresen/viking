Sometimes, trees are not just trees.

Many millennias ago, our land was covered with trees.
In those times, man did not walk on the earth.
The trees were pretty much more alive in those times,
than they are now. Some say, they could even walk and
talk.

They were called Ents, by the elves. But their real name
is so long, it would take years to complete the very word.

However, as the years passed by, the Ents grew more and more
passive.
Their branches, once capable of crushing enormous rocks,
were now just waving gently in the wind.
Their roots, which once could carry them for miles and miles,
in one single day!
Now they were firmly planted in the ground.
The Ents has been sleeping for many centuries now. 
We often confuse them with ordinary trees.

But they are alive,
watching.

And only a fool would underestimate their power!
