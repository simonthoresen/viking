Have you ever heard about Tzeentch?

A foul god of chaos he is. Terrorizing our lands with his minions.

His spawns do his bidding in the chaotic realms. Nasty they are.

I have heard tales of a great champion of this chaos god, Arphaz.
With his artifacts, he will destroy most of what is in his way.
Beware! Of his evil sorceries, they can mutate and destroy anything. 

His orb is said to have immense power. More than anyone has ever seen in mortal lands.
Not to mention his staff, which he is never seen without. Long ago stolen from lady Wittgenstein.

It is said that once linked to the staff, you become in sync with the realm of the undead. 

I hope someone could get that staff out of Tzeentch's hands. 

For the sake of our future.

That's what I know about Tzeentch, for now.
