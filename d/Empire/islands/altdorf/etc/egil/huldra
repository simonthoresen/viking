Have you ever heard about Huldra?

I have never seen her myself, but she is supposedly a sight for the gods!
It is believed that once a man lays his eyes on her, he will never fall in love again.
I am not sure if I would wish to see her myself, because very few has and returned to tell about it.
They say she lives deep into the forest, and that you can actually meet her at the marshlands in the night.
But beware!
She will lure you, and you will helplessly follow her into the swamp! 

They say the marshlands cover the numerous bodies of men that has fallen into her trap.

Huldra's hatred for other women is also legendaric.
It is said that women should not go by themselves in the forest at night.
She is so jaelous of other women, that she will try anything to destroy them.
And her nails is not to be underestimated!

It is also belived that Huldra, somewhere, keeps a hidden treasure.
A well of wealth. 
So much gold, an ordinary man could live like a count, for the rest of his life!
But, when I think of the risk, of appraising such a treasure.
Blood money.

It makes me shiver with fear.
The treasure might as well be just a fairytale.

This is what I have heard about Huldra.
