The norns

The Norns governs the fate of both men and gods.
They live under the great ash tree Yggdrasil,
near the pool of Urdar.
Their names are Urd, Skuld and Verdandi,
and they represent the past, future and present, respectively.
They weave the web of fate,
Urd and Verdandi working with care and skill, but their sister,
Skuld undo their work, tearing it to shreds.
She is the uncertainty of the future.

Urd is the oldest of the three,
she looks constantly backwards into the past.
Verdandi is young and active, seeing only in front of her.
Skuld's eyes are covered by a veil,
at times she are holding a closed book or a thightly bound scroll.
