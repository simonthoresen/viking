A new heaven, a new earth

In time the flames will die,
and the universe will become cool once more.
From the depths of the ocean a new earth will rise,
with rich vegetation and fields of ripe golden grain.
The daughter of the sun shall climb high into a clear blue sky
and shine forth in greater splendour than her mother before her.

Throughout the destruction a woman named Lif and a man called
Lifthrasir lay hidden within the World Tree.
They will emerge and run in joy across the land.
From them shall come a new race of men to live upon the earth.

Vidar and Vali will walk upon a new heaven unharmed by
the ravages of fire and flood.
They will live upon the plain of Ida,
where the realm of the gods once lay,
and shall build a new Asgard far greather than before.
To them shall come Modi and Magni bringing their father's hammer,
Mjolnir, then Honir, and from the realm of the dead Hodur.

Finally, as radiant as the morning sun, Balder will return.
Reborn in glory he will arrive to lead the gods in the new age.
Together, and forever, they will rule over the new green earth.
