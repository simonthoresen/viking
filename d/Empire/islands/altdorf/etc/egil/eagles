Eagles

Mighty birds they are.
Unlike most birds, they do not need to flap their wings
in order to fly high up in the sky.
On the slightest breeze they glide,
over majestic mountains.
Taking them to distant lands.

Actually, I have even seen a couple of examples of
the species here in Reikland.
I have even seen their nest in the mountains,
south of the village.
Oh, how I wish I could fly up there.
How can a simple peasant fly? With wings? 
I guess magic is the only solution.
But such magic is beyond me.
And I doubt I would be very welcome up there.

But still, I wish...
