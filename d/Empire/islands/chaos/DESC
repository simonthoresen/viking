This is the realm of chaos. It is accessible through a portal (obj/portal.c) at
wherever that portal exists. Any event in another island may simply spawn an
instance of that object to create an invasion into that island. This submission
includes an invasion event in altdorf (../altdorf/events/chaos_portal/event.c).

At any time there will always be 5 chaos warriors on this island. If one is
killed, the island will spawn another. All warriors walk towards the portal and
stay there. This is to make it tricky once people enter the portal. If the
portal is closed on the invaded island, the only way to get off is by throwing
one self off the island (into the void). That will move the player back to
altdorf through a funny falling sequence.

There is also a single event, which is a port of Lord Angron from Reikland. His
item set is a bit changed, but mostly to clean up code and mechanics.
