- no daemons for a boss, all tracking is done in the boss itself. to find a boss
  instance, query the ruinsd.

- shop in altdorf sells a weaponblank for 100 tokens, where you choose at
  buy-time what shape it has (sword, dagger, mace ...) the shape decides basic
  damage types.

- weaponblank must be heated in onyxia deep breath (deep breath does
  all_inventory()->onyxia_deep_breath()). heated blank must be tempered in
  onyxia's blood. this makes it +200 wc and get all elemental damage types.
