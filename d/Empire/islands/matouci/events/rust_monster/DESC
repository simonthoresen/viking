This monster will wear_out anything it touches or hits it. It should be bloody
hard to beat, since you will be loosing all metal items you are carrying. I am
not really sure how anyone would go about defeating this mob. It drops a unique
sword.
      
The sword 'tyrfing' uses the critical damage system in std/daemons/criticald.
If a hit scores high enough damage in "__damage_dealt", it will inflict a
critical whose severity is based on the shape of the mob being fought. This
means that the less hp the monster has, the more damage the critical is likely
to do.

The sword is cursed and will randomly inflict a VERY bad critical on its
wielder. The chance of this happening increases for every heart beat where it
does not. The curse will wear off once the sword has killed its owner 3 times.

Part of this encounter is the introduction of the following mechanics:
- /d/Matouci/std/daemons/criticald.c
- /d/Matouci/std/blood.c
- /d/Matouci/std/limbloss.c
- /d/Matouci/std/wound.c

To try fighting rusty, go to "/players/khaine/prison" and type "equip". Then
clone rusty. This will give you a chance to fight rusty with a full set of metal
gear.

I equipped a default hurtme, and after 76 rounds all pieces of armour were
gone. It reported the following:

Round:76  Damage:17   Total:2642  Average:34.763157  Max:83

I wielded the sword with 29 str and 29 dex, and fought a default hurtme:

===> Round:420  Damage:154   Total:10007  Average:23.82619  Max:137
