ring.c
- deducing from /d/Empire/CHANGES (randomness added due to mages) my guess is 
  that this blows up when doing aoe
- i updated D_CRITICAL to not allow one player to inflict multiple crits in the
  same combat round
- i would like to remove the randomness of calling D_CRITICAL, since the 
  damage_dealt() method in D_CRITICAL is supposed to be sufficiently balanced
  so that everyone can call it. there is already a 20% chance there, as well as
  the new time blocker
