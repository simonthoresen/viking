The maze of Blackrock mountain is a randomly generated area that contains a vast
seleciton of level 25 - 35 wandering monsters. At the heart of the maze is a
treasure chest. Once the chest is opened, the keeper of Blackrock spawns at the
entrance and initiates the creation of a new maze.

Every monster inside the maze drops a number of "black coins" (up to
BRD_COIN_LOOT, depending on level of mob). The treasure chest contains
BRD_COIN_TREASURE coins. These coins can be used at the merchant at the entrance
to buy randomly generated items from EMP_D_ARMOUR and EMP_D_WEAPON, with
randomly generated enchants from EMP_D_ENCHANT.

When a player moves through the maze, he leaves a "crumb" that lasts for 60
seconds that allow the mobs within the maze to follow him. This means there is
no easy way to run from a fight, and newly spawned mobs will come for you.

All critters inherit std/critter, which ha built-int scaling and special attacks
based on danger-level. The monster code in obj/ is mostly about setting up 
unique descriptions and equipment, but in some cases it also adds some extra
flavor effects.

- devil:        cloak
- drake:        black coin
- efreet:       belt
- elemental:    black coin
- gargoyle:     shield
- ghoul:        glove
- golem:        armour
- lich:         ring
- mind_flayer:  amulet
- minotaur:     boot
- ooze:         black coin
- skeleton:     black coin
- wraith:       helmet

All of the rewards have already passed through QC, so the only QC issue with
that is the goodness of the items that one can buy for the black coins. The
translation from coins to item and enchant goodness can be configured using
defines inside obj/merchant.c

Keep in mind that an item with quality 100 is as good as the mudlib allows
without any specials (i.e. 20 wc, 4 ac). All quality beyond 100 contributes to
an enchant, where 100 enchant value equals a level 29 Runewaker enchant, 200
equals two level 29 enchants, etc. For instance, a 150 quality sword has wc 20
and half a level 29 Runewaker enchant. 

The following defines are available for tuning:
- BRD_COIN_LOOT(dgr): the number of coins rewarded at the given dangerlevel.
- BRD_COIN_TREASURE:  the number of coins in the treasure.
- BRD_COIN_PER_QLTY:  how many coins to pay per 1 quality.
- BRD_ARMOUR_QMIN:    the lowest quality armour that can be bought.
- BRD_ARMOUR_QMAX:    the highest quality armour that can be bought.
- BRD_WEAPON_QMIN:    the lowest quality weapon that can be bought.
- BRD_WEAPON_QMAX:    the highest quality weapon that can be bought.

With a ARMOUR_QMAX = 250 and COIN_PER_QLTY = 5, one would have to pay (250 * 5)
= 1250 coins for the best possible reward. With BRD_COIN_LOOT rewarding 1 - 10
coins, one would have to kill somewhere between 125 and 1250 mobs to buy one
such item.
