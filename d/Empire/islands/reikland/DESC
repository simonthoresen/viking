This island is intended to hold all content ported from /d/Reikland in an effort
to clean up the Reikland codebase. This initial submission is basically just to
have it pass through QC before opened. It contains no new mechanics or content,
it is simply a large open area that holds a lot of critters ported from old
Reikland.

Currently New Altdorf and Onyxia's Lair are the only connected areas. 

I am aiming to port most of the critters from Reikland in a short while, making
the wildlife a little more varied. Eventually I will be porting events such as
barbarian, ent, etc.
