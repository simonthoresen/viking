This event creates 2 random mobs from /room/monster/ and lets one mount the
other by using a set of reins that are dropped when the rider is killed. Those
reins allow the player to mount any mob that is a) lower level than the player,
and b) not more than level 5.

When mounted, the player gets his short-desc changed to include the mount he is
riding, he gets a different min/mout, and he is assisted in combat by the mount.

This should be great fun, but really not give much benefit to anyone.
