The Empire is a collection of pre-generated static islands. Each
island is described by an island.c file in a subdirectory of
[islands/]. The one being submitted for QC is matouci.

The command [com/w/igen] will generate room files in
[var/islands/]. The room files written are based off the terrain type
in the map returned by the island object, but can be extended by
adding subdirectories of the corresponding map-type to the
islands-directory. To extend the "a" map-type, add an [a/room] file to
the islands directory. Matouci has only done this for the 3 special
rooms; A - entrance, B - exit, and R - runewaker guild.

All the events submitted have already been QC'ed for Matouci, except
for the Jormungand serpent, they have only been moved. The serpent had
to be modified, as it was a wandering mob in matouci. It will now
extend to cover the 3 x 3 rooms surrounding it's spawn point.

All time, weather, season and room descriptions have been copied from
Reikland (and cleaned up).

The Empire has no core daemons that are required to run for the area
to work. The rooms are completely stand-alone and will even clean
themselves up if not in use. To see what rooms are currently loaded,
you can try the command "imap <island>" (all loaded rooms have
colour).

Oh! And obviously there is anarachy in the entire region now.
