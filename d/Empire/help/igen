NAME

    igen

DESCRIPTION

    The "igen" command is short for "island generator", and is the command used
    to generate the room files of an island. This has to be run whenever the 
    map of an island has changed. The syntax is simply "igen <island>".

    Calling this function will create and execute a task object that takes care
    of creating all the files. This object will reside in your inventory, and 
    it can be examined to see its progress. 

    Beware that running this command will destroy and delete all the existing 
    room files, meaning that any player present on that island will be kicked
    off to the Larstown church.
