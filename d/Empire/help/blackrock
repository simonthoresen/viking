NAME

    Blackrock

DESCRIPTION

    The island "Blackrock" is part of the Empire. It uses the island generation
    code extensively, as it will randomize and recreate itself whenever someone
    reaches its innermost sanctum.

    If there are any problems with Blackrock, your best bet as an Arch or 
    maintaining Wizard is to simply run "igen blackrock" to recreate all the 
    room files.
