NAME
    
    EMP_I_EVENT - base object for island events

DESCRIPTION

    To create an event you must first create a directory for the event inside
    the events-directory of the parent island. Inside this directory you must
    put all the event content, as well as a file called "event.c" which
    inherits EMP_I_EVENT.

    void set_player_msg(string val):

    void set_room_msg(string val):

    void set_nearby_msg(string val):

    void set_nearby_range(int val):

    void set_island_msg(string val):

    void set_world_msg(string val):

    void add_event_object(string val):

    Once the event has passed QC it is enabled by putting a file called
    "ENABLED" inside the event's directory, and reloading the island.
