NAME

    Empire

DESCRIPTION

    The Empire consists of an extensive library of tools and frameworks, as 
    well as several map-based areas called "islands". The tools can be found
    in /d/Empire/daemons/, /d/Empire/obj/ and /d/Empire/std/. The islands are
    located in separate directories in /d/Empire/islands/.

    For the reusable inheritable objects, real objects and daemons, please see
    the /d/Empire/empire.h file and go from there.

    Although the layout of an island would suggest that the Empire uses some
    kind of virtual rooms, it does not. Instead it uses a command called 
    "igen" that can be found in /d/Empire/com/w/ to create separate room-files
    for every room in every island in /d/Empire/var/islands/.
