NAME

    wc - the weapon class

DESCRIPTION

    For a single hit, the class of a weapon is:

    ((weapon_class() + weapon_hit()) * 4 + str() * 2 + dex() * 2) / 8

    That is, the average strength and dexterity of the wielder contributes just
    as much as the set class and the hit-function's return value. Damage is:

    random(wc) - random(ac)

    This means that the weapon-class of a weapon intended for a level 29, with
    a target average damage 'x' (ignoring armour), must have a (weapon_class()
    + weapon_hit()) 'wc' equal to:

    dmg = random((wc * 4 + 29 * 2 + 29 * 2) / 8)
    dmg = random((wc * 4 + 29 * 4) / 8)
    dmg = random(wc / 2 + 29 / 2)
    dmg = wc / 4 + 29 / 4

    wc  = dmg * 4 - 29

    To achieve an average damage of 15, a weapon would need 31 wc.
