If there is anything bugging in the Empire and you can not figure out how 
everything hooks together, then add the Empire wizard commands:

    cmdpath /d/Empire/com/w/

Then do "man empire" and go from there. If you still have to dig through code
to figure it out, then please add a man page for what you feel is missing. 
These are text files in 

    /d/Empire/help/

Thanks.
