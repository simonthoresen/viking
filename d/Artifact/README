If you ever need to change anything in this guild due to balance reasons or
bugs, here is what you need to know;

- If some skill cost needs to be tuned, or some quest limit changed, edit the
  artichoke.h file and run com/w/artreload to reload all of the guild.

- In slivers/ there are hand-coded slivers that can be tweaked in-place. Once
  you have freshed the modified sliver, the sliver daemon will discover and
  reload it by itself.

- In slivers/x/ there are generated slivers that can NOT be changed directly. If
  you need to tweak these, you must edit the sliver generator
  obj/slivergen. Once you have saved your changes to that file, run
  com/w/slivergen to rebuild and reload all the slivers.

- The std/ directory contains mostly framework code. If there is a framework
  bug (like player object not being set, or some sliver method not getting
  called), this is where you need to look.

- The slivers/ directory contains all the modules that make up an artifact,
  including all the gameplay mechanics. If combat integration is faulty, check
  slivers/combat, if movement notification is broken, check
  slivers/notify_move, etc.
