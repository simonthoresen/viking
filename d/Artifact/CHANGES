- Going through all of weapon and sliver to reflect on is_idle() and
  is_suspended() before affecting the player.

- Decouple dependencies between soulstone, control, weapon and sliver. All of
  these are now stand-alone, i.e. there is no direct coupling between all of
  them. Soulstone knows weapon, and weapon knows player. All else is resolved
  on query.
- Added is_idle() and is_suspended() to weapon and sliver.
- Added get_instance() to ART_C_SOULSTONE
- Added get_instance() and new_instance() to ART_C_WEAPON
