help slots
   "A weapon starts out with $baseslots slots..."
   -> Should this be a variable/constant/define reference?

help inventory
   -> Needs changed to the same format as the other help files ("TITLE",
      "DESCRIPTION" and "SEE ALSO"). There is inconsistency in number of spaces
      after a period (0-2).

help <any topic that only outputs one line>
   -> This might be my client's problem, but I'll report it anyway. My prompt
       color changes no NONE when I run help on any of the topics like
       "artchat", "artwho", "bags", "cast". This does not happen when I do a
       random help like f.ex. 'help asd' and still receive only one line of
       output ("Not found, doing a keyword search for "asd":".

help score
   -> This topic should probably be included for Artifacts since the options
      (-s, -l and -L) are not available to us.

help machete
   -> "His is almost half a meter long." should be "He is almost..."

help eq
   -> Messy and doesn't make much sense. Make it the same layout as (most)
      other Artifact help topics? I suggest that the "SEE ALSO" sections refer
      to the 'consumed' command.
