Thread: Equipment idea.

I think it would be a good idea if instead of using equipment as a ordinary player.
Artifacts could look after materials in the item that was about to be consumed. and determine if it is a fit depending on what materials is in the weapon one currently are.  Should be possible to either overwrite slot locations or use some mechanism like the krylitz mages morph armour.

I think a change like this would increase the feeling of playing a weapon.

Another possibility would be to take the idea a bit further and add custom equipment slots for the diffrent weapon shapes.  having a grip, hilt, blade and such for a sword. Where you would need metal for the blade. Leather or cloth for the grip and so on.  For a staff you could add diffrent wood items for the ends or maybee metal if you used one of the metal quirks.

Would be fun to se the seccond option. but I guess that would take some work.
