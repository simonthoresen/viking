Thread: Healing

It's quite stressful to play artifacts when one more incomming damage then the regenerating heal is capable of handeling. Then it's necesary to get in the other heal once per round as it is now.   I think it might be a good idea to allow the heal  spell line to be cast more then one time per round.
