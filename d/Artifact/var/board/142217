Thread: Collection of bug

Seems that the harmful quest doesn't get updated in amril. WAs wielded by babar and he got killed but no update.

Party seems to bug a good bit. Sometimes other people then the wielder doesn't get added to the party for the arts.  When wielded in amril the art is allways listed as not present and standing in artifacts. 
And the cleanup of party at the end of wielding allso seems to bug a good bit.   Right now I'm still getting party say from some people that was in the party of the wielder. Event tho i did not see them in the party while I was wielded.
