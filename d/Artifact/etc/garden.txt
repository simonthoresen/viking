You find yourself in the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, a wonder celebrated by the
fables of the Greeks. They are as high as the top of the walls and owe their
charm to the shade of many tall trees. The columns supporting the whole edifice
are built of rock, and on top of them is a flat surface of squared stones strong
enough to bear the deep layer of earth placed upon it and the water used for
irrigating it. So stout are the trees the structure supports that their trunks
are eight cubits thick and their height as much as fifty feet; they bear fruit
as abundantly as if they were growing in their natural environment. And although
time with its gradual decaying processes is as destructive to nature's works as
to man's, even so this edifice survives undamaged, despite being subjected to
the pressure of so many tree-roots and the strain of bearing the weight of such
a huge forest. It has a substructure of walls twenty feet thick at eleven foot
intervals, so that from a distance one has the impression of woods overhanging
their native mountains. Amidst the other foliage grows a gigantic beanstalk so
tall that it reaches far into the clouds upon the sky.
