@unlocks help_guild
Hello, and welcome to the Artifact guild. As a member of the guild, you have
given up your human existence in order to live as a weapon of great power.

Contrary to what you might expect, most existing game mechanics actually play a
role in this guild. Your level, stats and skills, for instance, directly affect
what powers are available to you, and how well those are executed. You eat and
drink like mortals do to restore health and spell points, and you may even wear
armours and wield weapons to increase your stats.

There is quite a bit of mechanics to understand before you can play well as an
Artifact, so you are encouraged to read through all of the help topics before
you get going.

Once you are done reading through all the topics, you should be ready to enter
the world of the living. To do so, you enter the furnace.
