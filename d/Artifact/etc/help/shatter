If you want to leave your physical form and go back to the guild area, you
simply "shatter". Note that you may not shatter while your owner is in combat.

When your physical form shatters, either voluntarily or by damage, all the
items of power that you may have consumed will be destroyed. If you need to
temporarily go to the guild area to train a new skill or some spell, then
you should use "suspend" and "resume" commands instead.
