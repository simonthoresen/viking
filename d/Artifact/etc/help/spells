Spells are slivers that you cast on yourself while playing. Use the command
"spells" to see a list of known spells, and the command "cast" to cast one.

You can find the list of known and trainable spells in the spell-room of the
guild area. Like other slivers, spells have prerequisites -- until those
prerequisites are met, you will not even see such spells as trainable.

The number of spell slots available to you depends on the shape of your
weapon. Do "help shapes" to see this distribution.

Spells are temporary, they expire once their duration runs out.
