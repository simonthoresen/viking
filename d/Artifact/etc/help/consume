You may consume any food, drink, armour or weapon. The item you want to consume
needs to be either in the same room as you, carried by your owner, or in a
container carried by your owner.

When you consume a food or a drink, it has the same effect as if any mortal had
eaten or drunk that item.

When you consume a piece of armour or a weapon, you will automatically wear or
wield it. If the corresponding slot is already occupied, you need to release the
corresponding item first.  You can see what items you are currently using by
typing "consumed".
