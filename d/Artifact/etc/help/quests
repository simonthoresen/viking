The quests of the Artifact guild are among the prerequisites for just about
every guild power. Even advancing a level in the guild requires that you have
unlocked at least some set number of quests.

A quest might unlock a new skill or spell to be trained, it might unlock a new
quirk that can be selected in the furnace, or it might even unlock the use of
some exotic glyph.

You can find the list of available quests in the quest-room of the guild area.
As one quest is unlocked, others may become visible.

As a member of the Artifact guild, the only titles you may set once you reach
level 20, are those of the quests that you have unlocked. As some quests are
unique (meaning they can only ever be unlocked by a single player), some titles
are restricted to whoever unlocks those quests first.
