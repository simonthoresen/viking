Quirks are slivers that you choose while in the furnace. There is an enormous
amount of quirks available, but only those that you can use will be visible to
you.

The number of quirk slots available to you depends on the shape of your weapon.
Do "help shapes" to see this distribution.

Quirks are permanent, they can not be removed once you have left the furnace.
