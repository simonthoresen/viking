You can find the list of known and trainable skills in the skill-room of the
guild area. Like slivers, skills have prerequisites -- until those prerequisites
are met, you will not even see such skills as trainable.

Skills act both as prerequisites for most other slivers, as well as directly
influence the effectiveness of those slivers. E.g. as you raise your
"Restoration" skill, you will both unlock more restoration spells, as well as
increase the effectiveness of all restoration spells.
