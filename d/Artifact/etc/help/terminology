Furnace -- The room in which you compose weapon.

Glyph -- A permanent sliver that your owner inscribes on weapon. These are
dropped at random, and can be traded among owners.

Owner -- Whoever is currently carrying weapon.

Player -- Your etheral form, the complement of weapon.

Quest -- Quests are unlocked as their requirements are met. Quests are often
prerequisites of skills and spells, and they unlock titles.

Quirk -- A sliver chosen while in the furnace. Quirks with positive effects
require slots, whereas quirks with negative effects grant slots.

Shape -- A sliver that determines weapon type and slot allocation. As opposed to
other slivers that require slots, a shape mostly grants slots.

Skill -- Trained in the skill-room of the guild. Skills are prerequisites of
slivers, and skill level determines the effectiveness of those slivers.  Skills
may have their own set of prerequisites similar to slivers.

Sliver -- Any of glyph, quirk, shape, or spell. A sliver commonly has a set of
prerequisites on player level, stat, skill or quest.

Slot -- A typed unit of space occupied by a sliver. Most slivers require one or
more slots of the sliver's type (e.g. quirks require "quirk" slots).

Spell -- A temporary sliver that you cast on weapon. Spells are trained in the
spell-room of the guild, and cast using the "cast" command.

Title -- Rewarded by unlocking quests. At level 20 you are given the ability to
change your title to any of the unlocked titles.

User -- Whoever is currently wielding weapon.

Weapon -- Your physical form, the complement of player, created in the furnace.
