You may temporarily suspend your physical form at any time to go back to the
guild area. This will allow your physical form to remain in the world of men
while you run off to train some skill or spell.

Once you are ready to go back to the world of men, simply type "resume".

Notice that your physical form remains in the world of men, and that it may
still shatter while you are away. If this happens, you will not suffer death,
but you will loose all your consumed items.
