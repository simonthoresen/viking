The furnace is where you create your physical form. Here you will be presented
by a list of available slivers. Slivers are the building blocks of a weapon. A
sliver either grants or requires slots. You can see how many slots are available
to you by typing "score".

While in the furnace, you use the command "list" to see what slivers you may
choose from. First, you choose a shape sliver, and then you add any number of
quirk slivers. Once you are satisified, you "complete" the construction.

With you in the furnace is the weapon itself. This allows you to look at your
own form as you are constructing it.
