Glyphs are slivers that are inscribed on you by your owner. The glyphs can be
found by killing monsters, or they can be traded among owners in Abduhl's
Artificer shop in New Altdorf.

The number of glyph slots available to you depends on the shape of your weapon.
Do "help shapes" to see this distribution.

Glyphs are permanent. This means that you might have to shatter and go through
the furnace again if you want to make room for some new and exotic glyph you
just found.
