You will experience combat just as your user does; any damage dealt to the user
is also dealt to you. To stay alive you will need to eat and drink out of your
users inventory, and you will probably even need to use healing spells.

Beware that damage types and mechanics that are specifically designed to ruin
equipment will hurt you magnitudes worse than any other.
