A sliver is any of the nuts and bolts that make up a weapon. While in the
furnace you pick a shape sliver and a selection of quirk slivers. While playing,
you will cast spell slivers, and your owner will inscribe glyph slivers on you.

Slivers may or may not have some set of prerequisites to be satisfied before
they can be used. A prerequisite may be any of; level, quest, skill, or stat.

Also, slivers require or provide slots. Your power is limited by the number of
slots you have.
