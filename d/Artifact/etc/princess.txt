Rapunzel is a very beautiful, 18 year old, teenage girl, with large, expressive
emerald-green eyes, fair skin, rosy cheeks and a sprinkle of freckles across her
nose. She has a very slender physique, but her defining feature is her seventy
feet-long, magical, golden hair. She is wearing a lavender-purple and pink dress
with pink sleeves. Rapunzel is a spirited, clever, kind and playful young woman,
though a bit naive, but not afraid to stand up for herself or others. Having
spent all of her life in a tower with little else to do, she is very well read
and talented in almost all areas such as music and baking, and even more
advanced subjects like astronomy, having charted star patterns. But her greatest
passion is art, turning the walls of her tower into a mural. Not only is she
stunningly beautiful, she even delivers your mail.
