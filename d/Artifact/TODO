go through all echos to player, block where non-suspended is required
(obj is done, check rooms and slivers and std)


change island so that guild area becomes a shining light to enter.
if you are member, go to guild, otherwise go to adv_guild
change chaos portal to always get you to island when other end is
closed. if non member you simply have nothing to do. remove all
no_nothings. let water be accessible.
