If you want to do some testing of your mobs, you can clone
/d/Empire/obj/hurtmee. Whenever that npc either kills or gets killed, it will
output a large graph of damage done, attacks per round, etc.

This is what an average blackrock npc would output at the various dangerlevels:

At danger level 0:
===> Round: 146   Damage: 2     Max: 48   Total: 2537   Average: 17.26
===> Round: 146   Hits:   1     Max: 2    Total: 151    Average: 1.03
